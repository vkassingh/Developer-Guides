1. Requirement Analysis & Planning:
Business Use Case Understanding: Identify why the API is needed 
(e.g., data exchange, automation, payment integration).
API Specification Review: Check if the API follows which practice REST, SOAP, GraphQL, or gRPC.
Authentication & Authorization: Decide between OAuth 2.0, API Keys, JWT, or SAML.
Rate Limiting & Quotas: Ensure the API provider allows required throughput.

2. Choosing the Right Integration Approach:
Point-to-Point Integration (Direct API calls) – Simple but less scalable.
API Gateway (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway) – For centralized management.
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) (MuleSoft, IBM Integration Bus) – For complex workflows.
Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka, RabbitMQ) – For real-time async integrations.

3. Development & Testing
Mock APIs (Postman, WireMock) for early testing.
Unit & Integration Testing (Postman, SoapUI, JMeter).

4. Deployment & Monitoring
CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI) for automated deployment.



Best Practices To be followed!
✅ Separation of Concerns (Service classes, utils)
✅ Error Handling & Retries (Exponential backoff)
✅ Caching (Redis for performance)
✅ Logging (Winston for structured logs)
✅ Environment Configs (Dotenv for secrets)
✅ Mock Testing (Jest for unit tests)
